# Wiki

Welcome to the Documentation Demo!

Over here you will find the documentation for all of our projects. Please navigate to the landing page of each project for the entire list of available documentation.

## Overview

This is a sample repository created for the Documentation Wiki Demo. It is a quick POC meant to acquaint the audience with the our intended idea of moving all internal documentation to GitHub from various other sources, and to stick to a single platform for _development_ and _documentation_.

Some of the key benefits of adopting this approach would be:

- Riddance from the overhead for managing multiple platforms
- The same (read _similar_) workflow process(es) across Dev and Documentation teams
- **A convenient documentation review process**
- Enjoying the fruits of version control for documentation as well
- A log of the history of discussions, feedback, and decisions involved in drafting documents
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for documentation

## Documentation process

For every new piece of documentation we shall follow the Gitflow model, as done for the development process, i.e. taking a new _feature_ branch out of `master`.

Once the documentation has been completed a merge request shall be submitted to initiate the _documentation review_ process. After the review process has been completed and all feedback has been incorporated, the merge request shall be approved and the documentation shall be added to the `master` branch.
